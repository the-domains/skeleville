# Skele's Story

## Who is he?

This is it. It's time for me to come out of the closet. I've been thinking about it for years, but the time just wasn't right I guess. Now I think it is. Now is the time to tell the world who I am and what I can contribute. According to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, I'm an INTJ/Mastermind/creative thinker. And the latter sounds about right. I love to think about stuff; all kinds of stuff. I also like to plan and organize, to a certain extent. Mostly my thoughts, which are usually about changing the world. So I guess that makes me a mastermind as well? But not in a negative, manipulative way though. I hope. I just want things to be better, more efficient. I'm usually out when it comes to actual implementation though. That's the hard part. The not-so-fun part. The part that I'll lay the blame on for me being in that closet for so long.

I am a techie. I love to think about tech, and use tech, and look at tech, and... well, pretty much everything to do with tech. Just wish I could afford to keep up to date with new tech and had a decent way to get rid of the old. My current thing is Artificial Intelligence. Because that's the way to get more stuff actually implemented and done. I'm writing this as my self-introduction to the world, which will be made available via The Grid, which is an AI platform for websites. All I need to do is post; no site designing and whatnot. I am very excited to see how it'll present my content to the world, how it will mold the image that everyone will see when I tell it to publish for the first time. So psyched. If this was The Matrix I'd be Tank because "It's a VERY exciting time" for AI. That's my most favorite FAVORITE movie EVER by the way, which I first watched in high school. Hands down. Neo has been my role model for years, and was the person/character that got me into programming and tech initially. Blame him if I end up making Skynet...

I am also a philosopher. Well that's what many of my college-mates said I am. I guess it's true; I'm always seeking the truth. And it's in college that I started to discover that side of me. Majoring in Philosophy gave me the opportunity to think in many new ways, and lots of fodder for that thinking. Nothing that happens is by accident. Spinoza said that; I know it. Don't ask me how; it just makes sense logically. It's a metaphysical and epistemological thing. I also majored in Cross-Cultural Studies, but it wasn't as much fun as Philosophy to be honest. I learned a lot about the state of the world and different cultures though, and that kind of stuff actually concretized many things in the philosophy of human nature and ethics. So much to the point that I'm a gonnabe philanthro-entrepreneur as well. I want to help make things better, but one cannot do much with limited resources. So I gotta find ways to make money as a byproduct of making things better!

So there you have it. The coming out of the closet nerd. Lover of all things open.
